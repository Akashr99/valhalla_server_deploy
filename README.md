Prerequisites
AWS account with necessary permissions.
Terraform installed locally.
Docker installed locally.
Kubernetes cluster configured (e.g., using kubectl).
AWS CLI configured with appropriate credentials.

AWS Setup using Terraform
Navigate to the terraform directory.
Open main.tf and update the required variables such as region, ami, and instance_type.
Run the following commands:
terraform init
terraform apply
Verify that the AWS resources (EC2 instance, VPC, etc.) have been created successfully.

Docker Configuration
Navigate to the root directory.
Open the Dockerfile and ensure that the required dependencies and Valhalla server configurations are set correctly.
Build the Docker image:
docker build -t valhalla-server .

Kubernetes Deployment
Navigate to the kubernetes directory.
Open valhalla-deployment.yaml and update the image URL with your ECR URL.
Apply the Kubernetes configuration:
kubectl apply -f valhalla-deployment.yaml
Ensure that the Valhalla pods are running:
kubectl get pods

Load Balancing and Scalability
Load balancing is automatically handled by the AWS Load Balancer in the Kubernetes Service configuration.

Networking and Security
Networking and security configurations are managed by Terraform (VPC, security groups) and Kubernetes (Service).

Testing and Accessibility
Perform load testing using a tool like Apache Benchmark:
ab -n 1000 -c 10 http://<LoadBalancer-Public-DNS>/route-service

Verify accessibility by accessing the public URL of the Load Balancer in a web browser.
Bonus Tasks

Monitoring and Logging
Implement monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana. Configure container logging to AWS CloudWatch.

Scalability Plan
Describe your scalability plan considering auto-scaling groups, database optimization, and caching strategies.
